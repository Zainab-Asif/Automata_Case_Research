Deoxyribonucleic Acid(DNA) is a series of genes made by the mixture of nucleotides. The adjustment in the succession of these nucleotides can alter the hereditary data that bring about numerous disarranges in living life forms. There are methods in theoretical computer science such as Finite Automata, Mealy machine and Moore machine to examine patterns of DNA and analyze any change in nucleotides to prevent various genetic disorders. In the present study, these three methods were combined to evaluate their performance. It was found that the Mealy machine is much better as compared to others because it has less states, and react faster to inputs don't need for clock.
